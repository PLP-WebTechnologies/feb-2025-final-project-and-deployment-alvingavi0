                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hey there, Iâ€™m Calvin Otieno Wanyama â€” a passionate visual storyteller and tech enthusiast based in Nairobi, Kenya. My journey into photography began with a spark of curiosity and a borrowed camera. What started as spontaneous snapshots of everyday life soon evolved into a deep love for capturing raw, meaningful moments â€” the kind that speak louder than words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But behind the lens, there's also a coder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alongside my creative journey, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the world of technology. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and proudly enrolled in the Power Learn Project (PLP), where Iâ€™m advancing my skills through a Software Engineering scholarship. This experience has empowered me to build innovative digital solutions while deepening my understanding of how technology can transform lives and industries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Photography and tech are the two worlds where I feel most at home. Whether I'm designing intuitive websites, crafting visual identities, or editing a photo to bring out its full emotion, Iâ€™m always working at the intersection of creativity and code. I believe great visuals and great tech both tell stories â€” and when combined, they create unforgettable experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I freelance as a web and graphics designer, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible, both behind the camera and on the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks for stopping by â€” I hope my lens helps you see the beauty in moments, and my code helps you experience them in powerful new ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        â€” Calvin
